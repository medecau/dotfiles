# dotfiles

Oh hay!

These are dotfiles - configuration files for the shell, ssh, etc.
The files are shared here so friends and colleagues can pick-up some ideas or suggest changes, to keep me from adding silly stuff to the files, think access tokens, and to make it more accessible to setup new machines.
