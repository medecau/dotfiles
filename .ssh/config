# For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.
#
# The configuration files contain sections separated by Host specifications,
# and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of
# the patterns given in the specification.
#
# Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,
# more host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file,
# and general defaults at the end.
